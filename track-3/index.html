<div class="right">
  <p>A lone massive pale white dot way up in the sky. I sit outside and stare at you as I get so high.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <p>I think of things, I dream of things beyond our atmosphere. But sadly I am no astronaut so I'm firmly planted here.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <p>I think of meteors, I think of galaxies and things we just can't comprehend. And scary things like black holes and exploding stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <p>That could cause this world to end. I glance back at the moon, it looks beautiful, yet so bizzare.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <p>Amazing to think that a mere human on planet Earth could really go so far. Questions float up in mind like how far could we go.</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <p>And what resources are to gain? And how long could someone stay up in space without going completely insane?</p>
</div>

<div class="left">
  <p>And so I slip back to reality with thoughts still fresh in my head. As I walk back inside the house.</p>
</div>

<div class="right">
  <p>And pass out stoned upon my head.</p>
</div>
