<h1>Rose Tantrum</h1> 
<h2>Michael Earl Craig</h2> 
</div>

<p>A rose was throwing a tantrum deep in the botanical gardens. An angel fell in the bathroom,
knocked her front teeth out on the edge of the toilet. A long-haired dachshund was crossing the Bosporus Iâ€™m jumping around here. A rose. A tantrum. An angel saying it was the sink. A sign on a dumpster saying unwanted diamonds. But it was the toilet. Was definitely the toilet</p>

<div>
     <h1>The rose shook slightly</h1>
     <h2>but violently. Like a bruise</h2>
     <h3>happening. Sound of cable</h3>
     <h4>straining. The angel danced</h4>
     <h5>all night in a club. Music</h5>
     <h6>deafening. Rum & cokes.</h6>
    </div>

  blood on her chin. I fell<br />
  and smashed these in<br />

     <h2>to her mouth. On the sink!</h2>
